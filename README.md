# About Me:
I'm an adaptable and detail-oriented IT Security Professional with a passion for vulnerability management, risk analysis, and improving organizational security posture. I bring hands-on experience with Tenable Nessus vulnerability assessments, PowerShell automation, and federal compliance frameworks (DISA STIG, NIST 800-53), combined with strong technical communication skills from cross-functional IT work.

- **Security Focus:** Experienced conducting vulnerability assessments with Tenable Nessus, performing risk analysis, and automating remediation using PowerShell—achieving measurable improvements in security posture across Windows and Linux environments.
- Known for being a collaborative team player who can translate technical security findings into actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Skilled in managing competing priorities, staying calm under pressure, and approaching cybersecurity challenges with analytical thinking and persistence.
- Currently expanding expertise in cloud security (AWS & Azure), incident response operations, and advanced threat detection techniques.
- **CompTIA Security+ certified** and preparing for cloud security certifications.

I'm excited to contribute to teams that value security-first thinking, collaboration, and continuous improvement in protecting critical systems and data.
